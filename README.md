# JBC DIY station for T210 handles

This is my version of the DIY JBC station. I'm planning on using a 48V DC powersupply, hopefully adjusted down as close to 42v or a bit above :)

This is because the cartridges are 250W and around 7.2 ohms resistance, so that would require a DC supply of 42.42V :)

I think I'll see how the handle deals with the full 48V, which would be 6.6666Amps and 320W. It is temperature controlled afterall, :)
